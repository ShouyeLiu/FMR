Matlab source code and scripts for Fourier Mixture Regession (FMR).

MATLAB/FMR: this folder contains FMR and its subfunctions.

MATLAB/otherfunctions: this folder contains functions for postprocessing and figure generation

MATLAB/scripts: this contains scripts named replicate_figure[2-5].m, which use intermediate results files to replicate main results figures from O'Connor 2021 Nat Genet. It also contains run_FMR_UKB_N145kvs460k.m, which is used to produce intermediate results for Figure 2, and run_FMR_32traits.m, which is used to produce intermediate results for Figures 3-5.

To download the data that is needed to run FMR (including the scripts run_FMR_32traits.m and run_FMR_UKB_N145kvs460k.m), visit https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mclm1urkxs8ga80/AADDDABQYeGtyQxmom2raMkva?dl=0 and add the included 'matfiles' folder to the main directory (alongside MATLAB)
